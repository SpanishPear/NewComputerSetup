## Pre-Setup
- [ ] Get an Ubuntu ISO flashed onto a USB (rufus on windows) 
- [ ] Modify size of windows partition
- [ ] Run Ubuntu Installer with minimal installation, and no pre-software (hand up if you hates graphic drivers)
- [ ] Create partitions (via installer) for `/`(ext4) `/swap` (swap area) `/home/` (ext4) - size dependant on SDD, `/home` at least 30 GB `/swap` at least 210% of ram

## Ubuntu Setup
- [ ] Sign into Firefox
- [ ] Sign into LastPass Extension
- [ ] Sign into Social Media's(Google, Facbeook, Twitter, etc)
